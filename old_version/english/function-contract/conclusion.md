During this part of the tutorial, we have studied how we can specify functions
using contracts, composed of a pre and a post-condition, as well as some
features ACSL provides to express those properties. We have also seen why it
is important to be precise when we specify and how the introduction of behaviors
can help us to write more understandable and concise specification.

However, we do not have studied one important point: the specification of loops.
Before that, we should have a closer look to the way WP works.
