The goal of this first part is, in the first section, to introduce the
idea of program proof without giving to much details, and then, in the
second section, we will give the necessary instructions to install
Frama-C and some automatic provers that we will use in this tutorial.

Our tools are now installed and ready to be used.



The goal of this part, apart of the installation of our tools was to put
in relief two main ideas:


\begin{itemize}
\item program proof is a way to ensure that our programs only have correct
  behaviors, described by our specification,
\item it is still our work to ensure that this specification is correct.
\end{itemize}
