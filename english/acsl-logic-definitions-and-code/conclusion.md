In this part, we have covered some advanced constructions of the ACSL language
that allows to express and prove more complex properties about programs.

Badly used, this features can make our analyses incorrect, we then need to be
careful manipulating them and not hesitate to check them again and again, or
eventually express properties to verify about them to assure that we are not
introducing an incoherence in our program or our assumptions.
