| In this tutoriel, some examples and some elements of organization are similar
| to the ones used in the [TAP 2013 tutorial](http://www.spacios.eu/TAP2013/keynotes.html)
| by Nikolai Kosmatov, Virgile Prevosto and Julien Signoles of the CEA LIST,
| since it is quite didactic. It also contains examples taken from 
| *[ACSL By Example](http://www.fokus.fraunhofer.de/download/acsl_by_example)* 
| by Jochen Burghardt, Jens Gerlach, Kerstin Hartig, Hans Pohl and Juan Soto 
| of the Fraunhofer. The remaining ideas come from my personal experience with
| Frama-C and WP.
|
| The only pre-required to this tutorial is to have a basic knowledge of the
| C language, at least until the notion of pointer.

Despite its old age, C is still a widely used programming language. Indeed,
it does not exists a language available on so many different (hardware and
software) platforms, its low-level orientation and the amount of time
invested in the optimizations of its compilers allows to generate very light
and efficient machine code (if the code allows it of course), and that there
are a lot of experts in C language, which is an important base of knowledge.

Furthermore, a lot of systems rely on huge amount of code historically written
in C, that needs to be maintained and sometimes fixed, as it would be far too
costly to rewrite these systems.

But anyone that has already developped with C also know that it is a language
very hard to perfectly master. There are numerous reasons, but ambiguities in
the C norm, and the extrem permissivity that it offers, especially for
memory management, make the development of robust C program very hard, even
for an experienced programmer.

However, the C language is often chosen for critical systems (avionics,
railway, armament, ...) where it is appreciated for its performances, its
technological maturity and the predictability of its compilation.

In such cases, the needs in term of code covering by tests become important.
The question "is our software enough tested ?" becomes a question to which
it is very hard to answer. Program proof can help us. Rather than test all
possible and (un)imaginable inputs to the program, we will "mathematically"
prove that there cannot be any problem at runtime.

The goal of this tutorial is to use Frama-C, a tool developped at the CEA
LIST, and WP, its deductive proof plugin, to learn the basics about C program
proof. More than the use of the tool itself, the goal of this tutorial is
to convince that it is more and more possible to write programs without any
programming error, but also to sensitize to simple notions that allows to
better understand and write programs.
