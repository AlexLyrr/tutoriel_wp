Inductive predicates gives a way to state properties whose verification requires
to reason by induction, that is to say: for a property $p(input)$, it is true
for some base cases (for example, $0$ is an even natural number), and knowing
that $p(input)$ is true, it also true for a $bigger input$, provided that some
conditions relating $input$ and $bigger input$ are verified (for example, knowing
that $n$ is even, we define that $n+2$ is also even). Thus, inductive predicates
are generally useful to define properties recursively.

\levelThreeTitle{Syntax}

For now, let us define the syntax of inductive predicates:

\begin{CodeBlock}{c}
/*@
  inductive property{ Label0, ..., LabelN }(type0 a0, ..., typeN aN) {
  case c_1{L0, ..., Lq}: p_1 ;
  ...
  case c_m{L0, ..., Lr}: p_km ;
  }
*/
\end{CodeBlock}

Where all \CodeInline{c\_i} are names and all \CodeInline{p\_i} are logic
formulas where \CodeInline{property} appears has a conclusion. Basically,
\CodeInline{property} is true for some parameters and some labels, if it
corresponds to one of the cases of the inductive definition.

We can have a look to the simple property we just talked about: how to define
that a natural number is even using induction. We can translate the sentence:
``0 is a natural number, and if $n$ is a natural number, $n+2$ is a natural
number'':



\CodeBlockInput{c}{even-0.c}



Which perfectly describes the two cases:
\begin{itemize}
\item $0$ is even (base case),
\item if a natural $n$ is even, $n+2$ is also even.
\end{itemize}
  
However, this definition is not completely satisfaying. For example, we cannot
deduce that an odd number is not even. If we try to prove that 1 is even, we
will have to check if -1 is even, and then -3, -5, etc, infinitely. Moreover,
we generally prefer to define the induction cases the opposite way: defining
the condition under which the wanted conclusion is true. For example, here,
how can we verify that some $n$ is natural and even? We first have to check that
$n$ is greater than $0$ and then to verify that $n-2$ is even:



\CodeBlockInput[1][9]{c}{even-1.c}



Here, we distinguish two cases:
\begin{itemize}
\item 0 is even,
\item a natural $n$ is even if $n-2$ is an even natural.
\end{itemize}

Taking the second case, we recursively decrease the number until we reach
0, and then the number is even, since 0 is even, or -1, and then there
is no case in the inductive that corresponds to this value, so we could
deduce that the property is false (however, we will see later that in the
case of WP, we need the Coq proof assistant).


\CodeBlockInput[11][14]{c}{even-1.c}



Of course, defining that some natural number is even inductively is not a
good idea, since we can simply define it using modulo. We generally use them
to define complex recursive properties.

\levelFourTitle{Consistency}

Inductive definitions bring the risk to introduce inconsistencies. Indeed, the
property specified in the different cases are considered to be always true, so
if we introduce a property that allows to prove \CodeInline{false}, we will be
able to prove everything. While we will give more details about axioms in the
Section~\ref{l2:acsl-logic-definitions-axiomatic}, let us give two hints to
avoid building such a bad definition.

First, it is possible to syntactically restrict what we allow in an inductive
definition, by making sure that each case has the form:

\begin{CodeBlock}{c}
/*@
  \forall y1,...,ym ; h1 ==> ··· ==> hl ==> P(t1,...,tn) ;
*/
\end{CodeBlock}

where the predicate \CodeInline{P} can only appear positively (so not negated
with \CodeInline{!} - $\neg$) in the different hypotheses \CodeInline{hx}.
Basically, it ensures that we cannot build both positive and negative
occurrences of \CodeInline{P} for some parameters which would be incoherent.

This is for example verified by our previously defined predicate
\CodeInline{even\_natural}. While a definition like:

\CodeBlockInput[1][11]{c}{even-bad.c}

does not respect this constraint as the property \CodeInline{even\_natural}
appears negatively on line 8.

Second, it is possible to ask the generation of a Coq version of a proof
obligation that needs the predicate \CodeInline{P}. For example, we can
write a function:



\begin{CodeBlock}{c}
/*@
  requires P( params ... ) ;
  ensures  \false ;
*/ void function(params){

}
\end{CodeBlock}



For example for our definition of \CodeInline{even\_natural}, we would write:



\CodeBlockInput[13][18]{c}{even-bad.c}



As Coq is more strict than Frama-C and WP on this kind of definition. If the
inductive predicate is too strange, it will be rejected with an error. And
indeed, with the bad definition of \CodeInline{even\_natural} we just proposed,
Coq complains when try to prove the \CodeInline{ensures \\false}, because there
exists a non positive occurrence of \CodeInline{P\_even\_natural}, that encodes
the \CodeInline{even\_natural} we wrote in ACSL.

\levelThreeTitle{Recursive predicate definitions}

Inductive predicates are often useful to express recursive properties since it
prevents the provers to unroll the recursion when it is possible.

If, for example, we want to define that an array only contains 0s, we have to
write it as follows:

\begin{CodeBlock}{c}
/*@
  inductive zeroed{L}(int* a, integer b, integer e){
  case zeroed_empty{L}:
    \forall int* a, integer b, e; b >= e ==> zeroed{L}(a,b,e);
  case zeroed_range{L}:
    \forall int* a, integer b, e; b < e ==>
      zeroed{L}(a,b,e-1) && a[e-1] == 0 ==> zeroed{L}(a,b,e);
  }
*/
\end{CodeBlock}

And we can again prove that our reset to 0 is correct with this new
definition:

\CodeBlockInput[16][30]{c}{reset-0.c}

Depending on the Frama-C or automatic solvers versions, the proof of the
preservation of the invariant could fail. A reason for this fail is the fact that
the prover forgets that cells preceding the one we are currently processing
are actually still set to 0. We can add a lemma in our knowledge base, stating
that if a set of values of an array did not change between two program points,
the first one being a point where the property "zeroed" is verified, then the
property is still verified at the second program point.


\CodeBlockInput[16][23]{c}{reset-1.c}


Then we can add an assertion to specify what did not change between the
beginning of the loop block (pointed by the label \CodeInline{L} in the code)
and the end (which is \CodeInline{Here} since we state the property at the end):


\CodeBlockInput[38][42]{c}{reset-1.c}


Note that in this new version of the code, the property stated by our lemma is
not proved using automatic solver, that cannot reason by induction. If the
reader is curious, the (quite simple) Coq proof can be found
in~\ref{l2:acsl-logic-definitions-answers}.


In this case study, using an inductive definition is not efficient: our
property can be perfectly expressed using the basic constructs of the first
order logic as we did before. Inductive definitions are meant to be used to
write definitions that are not easy to express using the basic formalism
provided by ACSL. It is here used to illustrate their use with a simple
example.

\levelThreeTitle{Example: sort}

We will prove a simple selection sort:


\CodeBlockInput[3]{c}{sort-0.c}


The reader can exercise by specifying and proving the search of the minimum and
the swap function. We hide there a correct version of these specification and
code (Answers~\ref{l2:acsl-logic-definitions-answers}), we will focus on the
specification and the proof of the sort function that is a interesting use case
for inductive definitions.

Indeed, a common error we could do, trying to prove a sort function, would
be to write this specification (which is true !):


\CodeBlockInput[6]{c}{sort-incomplete.c}


{\bf This specification is true}. But if we recall correctly the part of the
tutorial about specifications, we have to {\it precisely} express what we expect of
the program. With this specification, we do not prove all required properties
expected for a sort function. For example, this function correctly answers to
the specification:


\CodeBlockInput[8]{c}{sort-false.c}


Our specification does not express the fact that all elements initially found
inside the array must still be found inside the array after executing the
sort function. That is to say: the sort function produces a sorted permutation
of the original array.

Defining the notion of permutation is easily done using an inductive definition.
Indeed, to determine that an array is the permutation of an other one, we can
limit us to a few cases. First, the array is a permutation of itself, then
swapping two values of the array produces a new permutation if we do not change
anything else. And finally, if we create the permutation $p_2$ of $p_1$, and then
the permutation $p_3$ of $p_2$, then by transitivity $p_3$ is a permutation of
$p_1$.

The corresponding inductive definition is the following:

\begin{CodeBlock}{c}
/*@
  predicate swap_in_array{L1,L2}(int* a, integer b, integer e, integer i, integer j) =
    b <= i < e && b <= j < e &&
    \at(a[i], L1) == \at(a[j], L2) &&
    \at(a[j], L1) == \at(a[i], L2) &&
    \forall integer k; b <= k < e && k != j && k != i ==>
      \at(a[k], L1) == \at(a[k], L2);

  inductive permutation{L1,L2}(int* a, integer b, integer e){
  case reflexive{L1}: 
    \forall int* a, integer b,e ; permutation{L1,L1}(a, b, e);
  case swap{L1,L2}:
    \forall int* a, integer b,e,i,j ;
      swap_in_array{L1,L2}(a,b,e,i,j) ==> permutation{L1,L2}(a, b, e);
  case transitive{L1,L2,L3}:
    \forall int* a, integer b,e ; 
      permutation{L1,L2}(a, b, e) && permutation{L2,L3}(a, b, e) ==> permutation{L1,L3}(a, b, e);
  }
*/
\end{CodeBlock}

We can then specify that our sort function produces the sorted permutation of
the original array and we can then prove it by providing the invariant of the
function:


\CodeBlockInput[64][84]{c}{sort-1.c}



This time, our property is precisely defined, the proof is relatively easy to
produce, only requiring to add an assertion in the block of the loop to state
that it only performs a swap of values inside the array (and then giving
the transition to the next permutation). To define this swap notion, we use
a particular annotation (at line 16), introduced using the keyword
\CodeInline{ghost}. Here, the goal is to introduce a label in the code that in
fact does not exist from the program point of view, and is only visible from
a specification point of view. This is the final section of this chapter, for
now let us focus on axiomatic definitions.
